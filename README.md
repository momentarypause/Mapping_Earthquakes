# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose

Included in this repository is code for an earthquake map that can be viewed using the Mapbox Streets, Satellite, and Day Navigation views as well as the option to toggle between the following map overlays:
- size/color representations corresponding to severity of all earthquakes in the last 7 days (as of 9/2/2022)
- tectonic plates
- major earthquakes of magnitude greater than 4.5

Also included are popup markers that display the magnitude and location of each earthquake.
